<h3 align="center">Farm Monitor v0.1</h3>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
This utility is a simple monitoring and administration tool for small farms of
Windows servers. The monitoring aspect uses the Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) interface for retrieving information about the remote servers. For the
administration side command lines can be configured that can be executed for the
selected host.
</p><p>
<i>NOTE: As you can see from the version number this is still very much a work
in progress. I have some key features I'd like to add, such as aggregations,
and so it's probable that a breaking change will still occur before reaching a v1.0
release. I'll try and maintain the existing file format but can't guarentee it.</i>
</p>

<a name="Background"></a>
<h5>Background</h5>

<p>
The genesis of this tool was almost 10 years ago when I started working in the
HPC (High Performance Computing) arena. We had a number of environments that
consisted of application servers for orchestration and blades for raw computation
duties. Although the Sysinternals tools like PsExec, PsList, etc. are great for
automation and ad-hoc command line use there was still a fair amount of other
ad-hoc monitoring and administration to do which involved flicking between
servers. This was especially true outside the production environment where there
was no company-wide monitoring running.
</p><p>
Naturally time has moved on <i>a lot</i> since then. At that time there were
very few free tools available that exposed WMI, especially on Windows 2000. My
own command-line tool called WMI Command was the first phase of this project as
it allowed me to wrap the COM based WMI library in C++ and explore it.
</p><p>
With PowerShell now more readily available it is even easier to consume WMI
based content, and there is therefore more knowledge of it too, which is great for
ad-hoc querying. However I still thought a GUI based approach was still viable
once you'd worked out what sort of queries you wanted to run continuously, hence
this tool was born.
</p>

<a name="Hosts"></a>
<h4>Hosts</h4>

<p>
When the application starts for the first time the main view will be configured
with a single host - the local one. More hosts can be added, renamed and
removed from the main view. They can also be reordered so that hosts can be
grouped according to environment, role, or whatever. Each host has both a
specific "environment" attribute and a more general purpose "description"
attribute to aid with grouping and identification.
</p>

<a name="Tools"></a>
<h4>Tools</h4>

<p>
For administration purposes a number of external tools can be configured which are
accessible from the context menu (right-click) of a host. Each tool is configured
as a command-line where the selected host name will be substituted for the
<code>${HOSTNAME}</code> token on execution.
</p><p>
Out-of-the-box there are a couple of default tools configured: one to open a
remote desktop via the <code>MSTSC</code> tool and another to continuously
<code>PING</code> the host.
</p>

<a name="WMIQueries"></a>
<h4>WMI Queries</h4>

<p>
The main view is used to display information about the configured hosts via WMI
queries. The monitoring is currently done manually by using the "View | Refresh"
option (or hitting F5) and will sequentially poll each server in turn to update
the data. Hosts which are temporarily off-line or that you do not want to
monitor can be marked from the host details dialog.
</p><p>
The icon next to a hostname displays its current status. It starts off as a
question mark to show that its status is unknown. When the view is refreshed and
the WMI queries are run it will update to either a green or red circle depending on
whether or not the host was contactable to service the queries.
</p>
<p>
The default WMI queries are just examples of what can be used and should work fine
against most hosts. They show the total and free memory available, the total and free
disk space for drive C:, and the date/time when the machine was last rebooted.
The final column, "Last Error", will show any major error that occurred trying
to connect to the host, such as if authentication failed. Errors that only
occur for some queries, e.g. no E: drive exists, will be reported in the specific
column as <code>#N/A</code>.
</p><p>
If a host requires different credentials to attach to it, then they can be
configured in the host details dialog. Alternate credentials will only be
prompted for once and then cached indefinitely.
</p>

<a name="QueryAttributes"></a>
<h5>Query Attributes</h5>

<p>
From the "View | Queries..." dialog you can manage the queries that are
executed against every host marked for monitoring. The following fields are used
to define a query:
</p>
<table id="QueryFields">
<tr>
  <th>Field</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Column Heading</td>
  <td>The text to use in the column heading of the main view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>WMI Class</td>
  <td>The name of the WMI class to query on. By default FarmMonitor only queries
      for objects under the <code>\root\cimv2</code> name space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>WMI Property</td>
  <td>The name of the property from the WMI class specified above that you
      want to display.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Formatting</td>
  <td>Choose how the value of the WMI property should be displayed. The various
      options are explained below in <a href="#FormattingValues">Formatting Values</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Filter Property</td>
  <td>The name of an optional WMI property on which to filter for a specific
      object in the set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Filter Property Value</td>
  <td>The value to match the above optional Filter Property on, if specified.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
A query will by default display only the first object in the result set. For
classes like <code>Win32_OperatingSystem</code> where there is only a single
object it doesn't matter. But for objects like disk drives, which are queried
using <code>Win32_LogicalDisk</code>, it matters as you need to pick the specific
drive you're interested in. This is done with the optional Filter Property/Value
fields described at the bottom. For example, to pick disk drive <code>C:</code>
you would want to match on a Filter Property of "<code>DeviceID</code>" and a
Filter Value of "<code>C:</code>".
</p><p>
To find out what WMI classes and properties are available you'd need to consult
the MSDN. I normally use a tool like WMI Command or PowerShell to explore the
query first and then I know what I want to configure for monitoring.
</p>

<a name="FormattingValues"></a>
<h5>Formatting Values</h5>

<p>
Although the WMI interface is COM based not all values come through using the
most natural COM types. For example really big numbers, like the amount of memory
in bytes, is not passed as a 64-bit integer, but as a string. Date/times are
another example of values passed as strings. As such you need to provide a hint
to the query about how the value needs formatting.
</p><p>
The default format for any value is a simple string as most other types can be
coerced into that by the COM runtime. However there are some custom formats
that can be used to scale and add units to make values more readable. In particular
some larger values are represented in kilobytes, rather than bytes, and therefore
need to be scaled differently. This difference in scale is not automatically
detectable.
</p>
<table id="Formats">
<tr>
  <th>Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>%s</td>
  <td>Display the value as a simple string.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>%t</td>
  <td>Interpret the value as a WMI format date/time and display in the local
      date &amp; time format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>B</td>
  <td>Display the value in bytes as a whole number of bytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>KB</td>
  <td>Display the value in bytes as a whole number of kilobytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>MB</td>
  <td>Display the value in bytes as a whole number of megabytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>GB</td>
  <td>Display the value in bytes as a whole number of gigabytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>KB2MB</td>
  <td>Display the value in kilobytes as a whole number of megabytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>KB2GB</td>
  <td>Display the value in kilobytes as a whole number of gigabytes.</td>
</tr>
